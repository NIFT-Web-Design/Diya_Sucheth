        <h1 class="bold">The Craft of Bidri</h1>
        <p class="para">Bidriware is known to have its roots in ancient Persia but it developed and flourished in Bidar under the Bahmani Sultanate. During the Abbasid period in Persia (750-1258 A.D) copper inlaid objects were used in palaces and merchants’ homes. As the technique grew popular, silver and gold inlay also began and started being practiced in Islamic lands.

<h3 class="aoa">About The Artist</h3>
<p class="aoainfo">Mr. Khaleel Ahmed is a Bidri artist from Hyderabad, Telangana. He has been practising this craft for the past 40 years. This craft has been passed on to him by his father who went to an arts and craft college. The workshop has a total of eight members and is entirely managed by his family. His sons know the art of bidri as well but they work more on the forefront of the business. They take care of the order placement, deliveries and social media handling. Mr. Ahmed was introduced to today's technology - Google Pay, Instagram, Facebook, etc by his sons. Personally for him this has helped him boost his business drastically. The ease of order placement, removal of middlemen and social media presence all have contributed to his business to a great extent.</p>

<h5 class="psoc">Present Status of The Craft</h5>
<p class="pinfo">Bidri's industry hasn't changed much in the twenty-first century. Governmental and nonprofit organisations are striving to resurrect the fading trade through the formation of various co-operatives/self-help groups, but the artisans do not appear to be fully benefiting from them. Currently, artisans in Bidar can be divided into two groups: winners of National/State/Shilp Guru Awards versus the remainder of the artisans. The latter category, which has a larger number of artisans, is also thought to be migrating away from the craft. The well-known artists not only have a strong connection to their craft, but they also receive a significant amount of work and consignments on a regular basis.
